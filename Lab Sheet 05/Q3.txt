1. Shape of the Distribution
The distribution is unimodal (one peak).
Most delivery times are clustered around 35–50 minutes.
It is approximately symmetric with a slight right (positive) skew.



2. Skewness
Slight positive skew: a few delivery times are higher (60–67 minutes), stretching the tail to the right.


3. Frequency
Highest frequency occurs around the 35–45 minutes interval.
Frequencies decrease toward both ends of the distribution (20–30 minutes and 60–70 minutes).


4. Outliers
Potential outliers are the very low or very high delivery times:
Low end: 20 minutes
High end: 66, 67 minutes
